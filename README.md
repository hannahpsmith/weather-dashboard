## Usage
Upon visiting the application, the user will view the search bar in the upper left-hand corner. The user will simply enter the name of a city of their choice and click the "Search" button. This will display the dashboard with the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. This city will then appear in the search history on the left-hand column. To revisit any previously searched cities, the user may simply select a city to revisit the weather conditions. To clear the search history, the user may select "Clear History" just below the "Search" button.
